For more stuff about knowledge being actively constructed, watch Derek Muller's (Veritasium) [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQaW2bFieo8) on why you need to confuse people to teach them deep concepts, and read Seymour Papert's groundbreaking book on "learning by making", [MINDSTORMS](https://mindstorms.media.mit.edu/). (now free on MIT's website)

This is [another attempt](http://blog.ncase.me/a-system-made-of-stories/) of mine to do "blogging" as pictures mixed with words. Because it gives me a lot more flexibility in expressing ideas... and also because images are easier to share on Twitter and Tumblr.

Many thanks to Arthur Carabott, Dan Meyer, Julian Ceipek, & Scott Farrar for feedback on an earlier draft!
