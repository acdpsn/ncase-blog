This one's a _really_ short one. Five minutes to play/read:  
**[An Interactive Introduction to Attractor Landscapes](http://ncase.me/attractors/)** 🗻🎱🗻

I actually made this a few months ago, but put it aside to work on [The Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds](https://blog.ncase.me/new-explorable-the-wisdom-and-or-madness-of-crowds/), and never got around to polishing and publishing it until now. I was considering making a series of mini-exporables around complexity science, and _Attractors_ was meant to be one episode of that. (And who knows, maybe I will actually make that series someday!)
