**UPDATE:** [This minigame is out!](http://ncase.me/door) T'was noticed by @notch, apparently.

When I was 8, I drew a maze with pen and paper. In this maze, there was your character's starting point, a door, and a key. On Valentine's Day, I gave this maze to my teacher-assigned mandatory playdate, (Singapore is weird) along with a red marker. I asked her to draw me the solution to this puzzle! Here's that maze, and the path my playdate was supposed to draw:

That day, I learnt the value of playtesting, because I did not playtest my maze, and the path she drew looked less like a heart and more like a cashew nut.

Anyway, that's the first game I ever remember making.

I feel like making a dorky door-key minigame for Valentine's Day. Like, mini-mini-game. Something you could finish in less than a minute. And it's a project I could finish in less than a day.

What interests me most about this is its one "mechanical plot twist" - you go through this rather typical minigame, and only at the end does it reveal what you did. _You did something and you didn't know it._ This might be a pompous comparison to make, but I think of the ending of Braid, where you run through the final level, but once you get to the end, everything plays backwards, revealing the _true_ story behind _what you just did_.

And, heck, I could let people share the game with To: and From: names, and add a lil' Patreon link to myself.
