What if you could make long-term memory a _choice_? And what if you could do that... through a _card game?_

My new explorable's out! This one's about the science of memory, spaced repetition, and shoeboxes:

üí≠ **[HOW TO REMEMBER ANYTHING FOREVER-ISH](https://ncase.me/remember/)** üí≠

This project came out of [the fan-poll I ran in June](https://blog.ncase.me/nickys-next-explorable-survey-results/), where y'all voted for "Learning How To Learn". It turned out that subject was _way_ too big, so after much navel-gazing, [in August I narrowed it down to Spaced Repetition](https://blog.ncase.me/a-way-too-philosophical-behind-the-scenes-post/). Next month I'll post another poll, for another explorable. Stay tuned!
