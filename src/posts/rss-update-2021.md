Hi! Quick update to apologize if my blog's been messing up your RSS reader recently.
I finally migrated from Ghost to [static site generator 11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/),
which I love and has been 99% wonderful to use.

The 1% was setting up RSS. See, 11ty _does_ have an "RSS" plugin, but it's actually Atom,
and I was 1) unsure if switching from RSS to Atom would mess with legacy readers,
and 2) being a stan for the RSS brand. So, I tried modifying their plugin to _actually_ use RSS.

Well, apparently I suck at implementing RSS. My feed's Atom now.

Thank you to Micha≈Ç, Ian, Victor, Tim, Dan, and Ben for catching _multiple_ glitches with
my "RSS" (now Atom) feed! And thank _you_ for continuing to use RSS/Atom,
keeping the web open and decentralized, standing guard against the attention economy robber barons
who'd pickpocket their own grandmaw's eyeballs.

Please email me if there's more RSS/Atom bugs!

<3,
