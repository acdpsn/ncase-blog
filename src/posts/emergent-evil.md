For my first [collaboration with PBS Frontline](http://blog.ncase.me/hello-frontline/), I've been reading lots of research on the psychology of genocide, massacres, and terrorism. Been doing this for a bit over a month now. Fun.

Anyway, as it turns out, psychologists have come to a shocking consensus about the minds of these kinds of people, people who can commit atrocities against civilians and children and feel good about it. Here's the terrible truth:

They're disturbingly normal.

![title splash](/content/images/2016/05/splash-1.png)

Wait, what? How can normal people participate in acts of mass, semi-indiscriminate violence? As social psychologists have found [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory#Robbers_cave_study) and [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) and [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) and [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobo_doll_experiment) and [again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment)... it's not the _individual_ that matters, but the _collective_. The whole is completely different from the sum of its parts. (sidenote: No, I'm not including Zimbardo's infamous [Stanford Prison Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment). That study had so many methodological flaws, and was never replicated. Zimbardo's [other, less-known work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation#Philip_Zimbardo_.281969.29) is much better.)

This is called **emergence**. Which can be a rather fluffy, abstract concept, so here's an analogy that helps me understand it:

Think of a cup of water. Now, think about that cup of water in a freezer. Even though in both cases it's the _exact same water molecules_, one's wet and slippery, and the other is cold and solid. The _only_ thing that changes is the arrangement of the _collective:_

![](/content/images/2016/05/ice.gif)(animation from [this TED-Ed video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UukRgqzk-KE))  

The same is true of humans.

Think of 5 people doing individual jobs, getting rewarded individually. They'll probably do okay. Now, think of those same 5 people doing one job together, and all equally sharing the reward. If you've ever had the misfortune of being stuck on a group class project together, you know what happens. Because responsibility is diffused, everybody (except for the one nerd) slacks off, and y'all end up getting a C+. (sidenote: **One BIG exception:** this only happens with _extrinsic rewards_, like money or a good grade, and not _intrinsic rewards_, like honor or intellectual curiosity (you nerd).)

They're the _exact same individuals_ – the only change was in the arrangement of the _collective_.

But just as diffused responsibility for a job can make people [less productive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_loafing), diffused responsibility for an action can make people [less _moral_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility#Real-world_examples). The more people do `Horrible Thing`, the less likely one is to get caught, so even _more_ people do `Horrible Thing`, and so on. And that's just one of many, _many_ ways otherwise moral individuals can get broken by an immoral collective.

That's the idea of **emergent evil**.

Like all truly revolutionary ideas in human history, this one started as a couple of cheesy tweets. My friend Micah [twote the tweet above](https://twitter.com/scanlime/status/669962020033204224), but some peeps didn't understand what she meant by "emergence", (not their fault – again, it's a fluffy, abstract concept) so I replied with some dumb metaphor about water molecules.

That was six months ago, and I'm still on this train of thought.

Normal motives – even _noble_ motives – like wanting a sense of belonging, wanting to go on adventures with friends, wanting a bigger purpose and meaning to your life... those desires are all _exactly_ what terrorist groups take advantage of. (sidenote: **Another BIG exception:** While most terrorists are psychologically "normal", that's not true for "lone wolves", who, by the way, [only account for 1.8% of terrorist attacks](https://books.google.com/books?id=fxyE9J1igtIC&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=%22Ramon+Spaaij%22+1.8%25&source=bl&ots=-wMpgwVcwR&sig=PhWL3qucUVd-HRvyJ3PqlndkMzY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiAj4v659LMAhVJ74MKHVuNB9wQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=%22Ramon%20Spaaij%22%201.8%25&f=false).)

_The water we drink to stay alive can be used to drown us._

Let me slap on a silver-lining ending.

One normal psychological quirk we have is the [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error), the tendency to believe that if someone does bad things, they must be a bad person. This belief, ironically, justifies dehumanizing a group of people who do "evil" things, and thus, making it morally permissible to commit violence against them, which will look "evil" in _their_ eyes, so they retaliate, so you retaliate, and so on. A vicious cycle of violence, **emerging** out of normal human psychology.

But by realizing the collective is _not_ the individual, and seeing things at a higher systems level, we can avoid going down that circular path. That is to say: **understanding the idea of "emergent evil" _is_ the best defense against emergent evil.**

_The flood that drowns us can be put through a dam, to give power to the people._

And if my cheesy water metaphors don't help in overcoming the horror of realizing every single one of us has the potential for enacting terror and trauma against the innocent, here, let this silly puppy GIF cheer you up:
