**The following is a rough transcript of my Thiel Finalist 1-Minute Lightning Talk. I can’t remember exactly what I said, but considering [I got the Fellowship](http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682017/), I think it went okay.**

**Copyright is broken.**

Copyright lasts a lifetime, plus 70 years, _by default_. Something’s up. Copyright was meant to be a compromise between creators & consumers. Nowadays, it helps neither.

But I found an alternative.  
My name is Nicklaus Liow\*, and I will make copyright obsolete.

Here’s how I did it. I got a few artists & musicians together, and we made [a bundle](http://garage.commonly.cc/) of our previously copyrighted work. We put it up for sale, but with a twist - once the creators have earned enough money, everything is _automatically_ released to the public domain.

This resonated profoundly with people. The artists earned $1000 from 150 buyers in 4 days. We even have Creative Commons staff as our official advisors. With their help, I’ve launched a new platform, and we can push our vision much further.\*\*

**The vision for a post-copyright economy.**

Copyright is not sustainable, enforceable, or even desirable.  
But here’s what copyright is.

It’s an excuse for monopolies to sue their competition.  
It’s filing a DMCA to shut up and take down your critics.  
It’s SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, CISPA... et CETERA.

Copyright was meant to be a compromise.

_That compromise has been compromised._

\* I now go by “Nicky Case”. I've always wanted to make a name for myself. Hah.

\*\* Later on in the Fellowship, I organized the followup to this project, [The Open Game Art Bundle](http://open.commonly.cc/). It was bigger, better, and raised $12K from 700+ people to release all that art & music to the public domain.
