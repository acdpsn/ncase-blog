**Misc thoughts:**

*   Was going to make it all sad at first, but that felt too clich√©d and one-note. I realized... it would be sadder if she was _blatantly in denial_, and trying to be happy! (Seriously, the scene in The Lego Movie where Unikitty tries so hard to think happy thoughts, was one of the most unexpectedly heartwrenching scenes I've ever seen.) So, tragicomedy it was. I'm starting to realize tragicomedy really is a good style for me. (or that many stories might benefit from a variety in moods)
*   I could do an interesting series of fiction-in-non-fiction formats. Programming is just one.
*   Could be a weird new way to teach programming.
