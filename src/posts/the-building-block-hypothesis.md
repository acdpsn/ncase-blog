First of all, this is _not_ how evolution works:

![line of evolution](/content/images/2016/03/Evolution-Of-Man-Parodies-333.jpg)

Evolution isn't linear, it's more like a tree. I used to believe evolution worked like this: 1) random mutation 2) non-random selection 3) repeat. And on the tree of evolution, mutation gives us more branches, while selection prunes the crappy branches:

![tree of evolution](/content/images/2016/03/1362626618-human-evolution.jpg)

Turns out, that's _also not_ how evolution works!

Not completely, anyway. I recently watched [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BppamGhulA) from the late John H Holland, when he brought up a strange fact. Even though evolution is slow, it has happened a lot _faster_ than would be predicted with just mutation & selection! _Mutation is not enough._

Here's the problem: the greater the mutation, the greater the chance of it mutating into a _worse_ state. (sidenote: This is why, contrary to superhero comics, radiation won't give you superpowers. Just cancer.) So, for mutation to be useful, it can only happen in very small steps, very slowly.

However, there is another force behind evolution, more powerful than mutation, yet doesn't get as much attention in the popular science press. It's a way to get _high_ variance in genes, yet ensure a _low_ chance of screwing up the DNA.

**Recombination.**

This slide, from the John H Holland talk I mentioned, does the best job of visually explaining what function recombination serves:

First, you need a set of _building blocks._ In this slide, it's face parts. In DNA, it'd be genes or chromosomes. Then, you just randomly slap building blocks together.

A couple things to note:

One: recombination gives you _exponentially_ many different valid combinations. With just 10 sets of 10 blocks, you can get 10,000,000,000 unique combinations. Two: because each block has already been proved to work, _combinations_ of blocks also tend to work.

In the above example, no matter what combination of eyes, ears, nose, etc you pick – despite a wide variance, you'd always get a decent-looking human face.

Now, imagine what if you used _mutation_ instead, with the same high variance: randomly changing how many eyes you have, what part of your face teeth grow, and where all the orifices should be... Well, you'd get something like this:

So, yeah. Recombination for the win.

This is probably why sex evolved – if you think about it, sexual reproduction seems pretty inefficient compared to asexual reproduction. Why can't we all just fertilize ourselves, and get a lil' baby clone? For sex to be so, uh, popular, it must give a benefit so huge it overcomes that giant cost. (sidenote: And yes, some complex animals [actually do asexually clone themselves!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis))

Since asexual reproduction occurs mostly in bacteria and plants, sometimes in invertebrates, and _never_ in mammals (outside the lab), I'm guessing that recombination doesn't just _increase_ complexity, **recombination is _necessary_ for complexity.** (sidenote: I should note that, even though bacteria don't sexually reproduce, they still do a lot of recombination through [horizontal gene transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer). So, another point for recombination.)

So, evolution's not a line, not even a tree, it's a... whatever the heck this shape is:

![wibbly wobbly](/content/images/2016/03/wobbly.png)

Now, why do _I_ care about all this?

Well, one, it's fascinating. All this time I've been snubbing my nose at creationists, I've been mistaken about the fundamental mechanics of evolution. Hurray for me being wrong.

And two, I think this also gives insight into our **cultural evolution.**

If recombination is _necessary_ for complexity, then what does it mean we're in a world of specialized disciplines, filter bubbles, and polarized politics? Does that mean less variation in thought, less evolution in our culture? (sidenote: For comparison, the genetic equivalent of "recombining" within a small, similar gene pool is, uh, incest. So. There's that.)

**Possible Solutions:** Do more inter-disciplinary work. Learn stuff outside your filter bubble. And perhaps most painfully, take [a personal effort to depolarize your politics](http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/02/17/the-seven-habits-of-highly-depolarizing-people/).

And even _within_ a single community, there's no guarantee people will combine & create new ideas. They could just repeat what others in their community say, to gain social points. (a sadly common phenomenon known as [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink)) Or maybe only a few people are deemed the Leaders, Creators, Geniuses, and everyone else's place is to be a fan, a follower, a consumer. Both are recipes for halting social evolution.

**Possible Solutions:** Always challenge your group's and your own ideas. If you're an educator, give your students the tools to construct ideas for themselves, and combine their knowledge with each others'. Break your art/code/work down into modular building blocks, and [open source 'em](http://choosealicense.com/) or [use Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/). (sidenote: Yeah, this is mostly me rambling advice to myself here.)

In short, get your building blocks _from_ everyone, and give away your building blocks _to_ everyone.
