So, you want to design a plushie! ("soft toy", if you're English)

And not just a flat, two-pieces-of-cloth plushie. No: you want _three D's._

To do that, you first need to transform a 3D surface into 2D pieces, to cut into fabric & sew together. The two most common methods are: 1) be a wizard and do this in your head, or 2) use a 3D modelling software, i.e., be a wizard.

I ain't got time for that, and neither do you!

But recently, I was inspired by [this designer's tutorial](http://laurenvenell.com/epic-how-to-make-a-3-d-plush-pattern-from-a-2-d-drawing/), where she wraps fabric around carved foam. I wanted cheaper/easier materials, so I made a variant where you wrap paper towel pieces around Play-Doh.

Let's start!

What You'll Need
----------------

*   **Modeling clay** (not necessarily Play-Doh, it just made the title alliterate)
*   **Paper Towel**
*   **Scissors** (preferably small, to cut tight curves)
*   **Pen**
*   Optional: tape
*   Optional: straight pins

### Step 1: Mold your 3D form

Come on, you did this as a kid. It doesn't have to look smooth, just approximate.

For this tutorial, I'm making a [Peep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeps)!

### Step 2: Cover its surface

Cut out a small piece of paper towel, and press it gently against your clay's surface. (optional: use a pin to keep it in place)

Draw the edge of where the clay touches the paper:

Cut away everything _outside_ of the edge, and that's your first 2D piece! Repeat until you've covered the whole surface. Tip: write notes on the pieces, to keep track of where they go.

(If a piece can't wrap around the clay without making awkward folds, you may have to split it into two pieces, or snip out the fold to create a ["dart"](https://whileshenaps.com/2011/03/elements-of-soft-toy-design-15-triangular-darts.html).)

**And that's it! You just turned a 3D surface into a 2D pattern! üéâ**

To save your pattern, you can just scan or take a photo of your pieces as-is.

But I wanted to clean mine up first. So, I took a photo & digitally traced the outlines... so that _you_ can download this Peep Plushie Pattern! ([right click & save](/content/images/2020/03/design.png))

In total, designing this plushie pattern took me **one hour.** On my _first try._

You'd expect some kind of catch, but it really _was_ that easy! All that was left for me to do was, uh, y'know...

### Step 3: Make The Rest Of The Friggin' Plushie

This tutorial's just about how to _design_ a plushie pattern, not _sew_ one, but I'll list the main steps & leave links to other tutorials!

First, copy the pieces onto a fabric...

![](/content/images/2020/03/8-1.JPG)

Cut them out...

Sew exterior details first, like the eyes... (see: [how to hand sew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvzMMcKHVR4))

![](/content/images/2020/03/10.JPG)

Stitch the pieces together _wrong side out_, so I can turn it inside-out later...

![](/content/images/2020/03/11.JPG)

Don't forget to leave a big enough hole somewhere, to put in the stuffing!

Stuffing!

Then close up the hole, knot the thread, and bury the knot inside your fluffy lil' boy. (see: [how to invisibly close plushie holes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2B_fgEGMlM) and [hide knots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCymy196zlM))

‚ú® FABULOUS ‚ú®

As you can see, the plushie's final form is pretty close to the clay model. Just slightly chubbier, thanks to all that stuffing:

Peeps dream of flying:

And sometimes, dreams really do come true:

Now you know how to turn _any 3D form you like_ into a 2D plush pattern, no wizards required. Happy pattern-making! üê•
