Today, I started [my Knight/Mozilla OpenNews Fellowship](https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/2016meet/) at PBS Frontline! So I'll be here in Boston, MA for the next ten months. (sidenote: Also, looking forward to schmoozing at the MIT Media Lab, also here in Boston.)

Anyway, pretty dang excited to be here! The first thing you see walking into Frontline's office – once you find your way through the labyrinthine WGBH building – are the Emmys, Emmys everywhere. Emmys filling up an entire shelf. Emmys that couldn't even fit on the shelf. Never seen an Emmy used as a paperweight before.

I won't be working (directly) on their TV documentary stuff, but I'll be part of their experimental digital team – making tools, interactives, simulations, and other shtuff. At their 10 AM daily meeting, I introduced myself, the new kid.

Because I overdo things, I did a Show & Tell.

I showed off a couple simulations I've made in the past, on social systems ([Parable of the Polygons](http://ncase.me/polygons/)) and natural systems ([Sim The World In Emoji](http://ncase.me/simulating/)), as well as a prototype sim on the US incarceration system. That's the core theme running throughout my presentation: understanding _systems_.

I ended with my favorite quote from my now-favorite film, _[Spotlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(film))_. At one point, Marty Baron, the editor of the Globe, sits his team down as says this:

_“We need to focus on the institutions, not the individuals. Practice, and policy. **We're going after the system.**”_

And soon, I hope to go after many, many systems.

**P.S:** Also, the OpenNews Fellowship wants my blog posts on their site, but they prolly don't want [my sleep-deprived bird-poetry](http://blog.ncase.me/sparrows-trapped-in-the-denver-airport/), so I'm creating a new tag for this called [“Journo Stuff”](http://blog.ncase.me/tag/journo-stuff/).
