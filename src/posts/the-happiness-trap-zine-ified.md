A while back, I read Russ Harris's [The Happiness Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Trap-Struggling-Start-Living/dp/1590305841/), an introduction to Acceptance & Commitment Therapy. It's really helped me out the last couple months, so I thought I'd share it with y'all -- as a _zine!_ Print it out & carry it around in your wallet or whatever. Enjoy:

To make your own copy of this zine, right-click the following high-resolution scan, select Save Image, then print it out:

To turn that into an 8-page zine, cut & fold the paper according to these instructions ([by withjulie](https://withjulie.deviantart.com/art/Sandwich-Origami-Mini-Zine-142773698)):

My zine adaptation is public domain, so feel free to copy, steal, do whatever you please with this thing! I also recommend checking out Russ Harris's original book: [The Happiness Trap](https://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Trap-Struggling-Start-Living/dp/1590305841/)

Best of luck, friend. <3
