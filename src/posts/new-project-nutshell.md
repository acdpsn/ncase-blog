After 2 years of procrastinating on this project... it's finally out! My first post-burnout-hiatus interactive thingy:

ðŸ¥œ **Nutshell: make _expandable_ explanations** ðŸ¥œ    
ðŸ‘‰ [https://ncase.me/nutshell/](https://ncase.me/nutshell/) ðŸ‘ˆ

This is a tool for writers, to let their readers dive into details. Not shown in the above .gif, are two other "killer features": 1) you can embed snippets of text *from other authors & websites*, even stuff written years ago! And 2) you can embed interactives, YouTube videos, and the intros of Wikipedia articles.

If you're writing a blog, news articles, code documentation, educational material, etc... I hope Nutshell helps you help *your* readers.

(See you next month... for explainers written *with* Nutshell!)

P.S: Testing, testing... let's see if this blog post can [:embed itself](#NewProject)...
